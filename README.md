# Sub-Patents_count_mapreduce

We need to write a MapReduce program to process a dataset with patent records. We need to calculate the number of sub-patents
associated with each patent.

Project Explanation:

Each patent has sub-patent idâ€™s associated with it. You need to calculate the number of sub-patent
associated with each patent. Here is the sample output:  

Sample Output 
 
Patent            Number of Associated Sub-patents 
1                                                 13  
2                                                 10 
3                                                  4
